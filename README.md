# About Project

# 1. Project Goal
- Use R to visualize covid-19 growth trend. And find differences in confirmed cases between China and other countries.

# 2. Analyze data
- In February, the majority of cases were in China. That changed in March when it really became a global outbreak: around March 14, the total number of cases outside China overtook the cases inside China. There were a couple of other landmark events that happened during the outbreak. For example, the huge jump in the China line on February 13, 2020 wasn't just a bad day regarding the outbreak; China changed the way it reported figures on that day (CT scans were accepted as evidence for COVID-19, rather than only lab tests).

- When trying to assess how big future problems are going to be, we need a measure of how fast the number of cases is growing. A good starting point is to see if the cases are growing faster or slower than linearly. There is a clear surge of cases around February 13, 2020, with the reporting change in China. However, a couple of days after, the growth of cases in China slows down. How can we describe COVID-19's growth in China after February 15, 2020?

- From the plot above, the growth rate in China is slower than linear. That's great news because it indicates China has at least somewhat contained the virus in late February and early March. How does the rest of the world compare to linear growth?

- Not all countries are being affected by COVID-19 equally, and it would be helpful to know where in the world the problems are greatest. Let's find the countries outside of China with the most confirmed cases in our dataset.  We select top 7 confirmed cases countries outside China.

# 3. Conclusion
- In this project, we analyze data before the whole world pandamic (March 2020). And We found that China control their confirmed cases well, however, other countries didn't. Other countries just began and exploded after March which is what we know for now.
